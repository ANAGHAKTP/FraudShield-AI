## 2024-05-24 - [CRITICAL] Fix hardcoded JWT secret
**Vulnerability:** The NestJS Gateway application had a hardcoded JWT secret ('super-secret-key-change-me') directly in the source code within `auth.module.ts` and `jwt.strategy.ts`.
**Learning:** Hardcoded secrets present a critical risk as they expose cryptographic keys directly in source control, making token forgery trivial for anyone with code access.
**Prevention:** Always use environment variables (e.g., `process.env.JWT_SECRET`) for sensitive keys, never providing a hardcoded fallback value. If a necessary environment variable is missing, the application should throw an error or fail to start to prevent falling back to an insecure state.
