## 2024-06-08 - [Intl Formatter Performance]
**Learning:** `Intl.NumberFormat` and `Intl.DateTimeFormat` are incredibly slow to instantiate. In React components with lists or tables, creating them inside the render loop (or inside mapping functions) for each item causes significant performance bottlenecks. Measurements show cached formatters are ~20-35x faster.
**Action:** Always extract and cache `Intl` formatter initializations outside the component or loop, especially when formatting multiple items like in data tables or lists.
